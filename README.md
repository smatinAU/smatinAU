- 👋 Hi, I’m @smatinAU! 
- 👀 I’m interested in limitless things, but I try to keep it reasonable. My biggest passion is obviously anything pertaining to technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning again, limitless things; I feel like your quest in learning never stops, but right now my primary focus is on QA engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything that involves aforementioned QA engineering. Anything to expand my knowledge and broaden my horizons. :)
